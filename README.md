Final Project

Website development, in collaboration with Loewenstein Rehabilitation Medical Center, for a weightlifting physiotherapy system. 
The system is embedded that combines a user interface, real-time data collection and processing and creation of a biofeedback environment.

The users of the system are the therapists. 
They can set up a practice, watch during the practice (the graph varies depending on the weight pulls) and watch previous practices.
